# Project 0x11 - Custom Printf Function

## Project Overview
This is the first team project in the ALX software engineering program, accomplished by a team of two students.
The project focuses on designing and implementing your own version of the `printf` function.
The designed `printf` function will be able to print formatted output to the standard output stream (`stdout`). The following format specifiers will be supported for the start:
- `%c`: Character
- `%s`: String
- `%%`: Percentage
- `%d`: Integer
- `%i`: Integer

The custom `printf` function should return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `main.h`: This header file includes the function prototypes for the custom `printf` function and any other necessary declarations.

- `main.c`: This file contains an example program that demonstrates the usage of the custom `printf` function  (`_printf`). It is mainlty used to test the functionality of the programme using the various format specifiers.
 


## How to Compile and Run

compile the code using the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c
```

To run the program, use the following command:

```bash
./a.out
```
